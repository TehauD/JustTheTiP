---

## I. BILL TEXT

### Kansas State Legislature / United States Congress

**The Truth in Politics Act**

**Bill No. TBD**

**Introduced By:** [Sponsor Name(s)]  
**Date Introduced:** [Date]  
**Referred To:** Committee on Government Ethics and Transparency / Committee on Oversight and Reform

---

### A BILL

To prohibit the intentional dissemination of materially false statements by political figures, recognizing such conduct as a direct threat to democratic governance, individual autonomy, and the constitutional principles of an informed electorate.

---

### SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE

This Act may be cited as the "Truth in Politics Act."

---

### SECTION 2. FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF POLICY

The Legislature finds the following:

1. Democracy is predicated on the informed consent of the governed. The right to self-govern requires access to truthful, factual information.
2. Knowingly false political speech by elected officials and candidates erodes trust in public institutions, manipulates electoral outcomes, and deprives the public of its right to make informed choices, thereby diminishing personal and collective autonomy.
3. The First Amendment does not protect deliberate falsehoods intended to defraud, mislead, or cause harm, as upheld in *United States v. Alvarez*, 567 U.S. 709 (2012), which recognizes a compelling interest in protecting the integrity of democratic processes.
4. States and Congress have the authority to regulate conduct in political office, particularly where it concerns fraud (*Illinois ex rel. Madigan v. Telemarketing Assocs., Inc.*, 538 U.S. 600 (2003)) and material misrepresentation (*Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.*, 418 U.S. 323 (1974)).
5. Numerous courts, including the Supreme Court in *United States v. Alvarez*, have acknowledged that while the First Amendment protects free expression, knowingly false statements made with harmful intent may be regulated—particularly where they undermine democratic integrity.
6. Existing legal doctrines in *Gertz v. Welch*, *Madigan v. Telemarketing*, and campaign finance law recognize the government's compelling interest in truthfulness and transparency in public discourse.

Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to establish legal accountability for materially false statements by political figures that undermine the public’s autonomy and threaten the functioning of our democratic republic.

(b) *Federal Version*: The Office of Congressional Accountability (OCA) shall be established as an independent oversight body, separate from Congress, reporting to the Government Accountability Office (GAO).

---

### SECTION 6. SEVERABILITY

If any provision of this Act is found to be unconstitutional or otherwise unenforceable, the remainder shall remain in full force and effect.

---

### SECTION 7. EFFECTIVE DATE

This Act shall take effect 90 days after passage and shall apply prospectively to all conduct occurring thereafter.

---

### SECTION 8. CONSTITUTIONAL COMPLIANCE

This Act is designed to comply with the limitations of the First Amendment by targeting knowingly false factual assertions made with malicious intent—not political opinions or protected speech. It seeks to balance freedom of expression with the protection of democratic integrity and individual autonomy.
